# Email Spam and Ham Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham. The project uses Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess email data, engineer features, and train a classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails effectively.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature extraction from email text.
- Training a machine learning model with scikit-learn.
- Evaluating model accuracy and performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-ham-classifier.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required packages:
```bash
cd email-spam-ham-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook email_spam_ham_classifier.ipynb
```

Follow the steps in the notebook to run the analysis and model training.
